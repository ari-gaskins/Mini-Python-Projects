# Program that adds two numbers provided by the user
# Logic: user gives cpu two numbers (a and b), cpu changes strings into intergers,
# cpu computes sum of the numbers, cpu prints sum

# get numbers
a = input('a = ')
b = input('b = ')

# convert numbers
a = int(a)
b = int(b)

# print computation
print(a+b)
